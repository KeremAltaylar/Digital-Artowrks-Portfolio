# # [Entanglements.00](https://keremaltaylar.github.io/Entanglements.00/) 
  
  Entanglements.00 is an interactive kinetic painting with hand control via your camera (Dont forget to allow your camera on your browser!). A machine learning model from mediapipe libraries is used for hand landmark detection. P5 Library is used for the flowfield technique which creates the smooth vectoral movements of tentacles. Aesthetically it aims to tribute to the machine revolution in the Matrix Iconography.

# # [Stringillum](https://keremaltaylar.github.io/Stringillum/) 
  
  Stringillum is an interactive kinetic painting with audio-reactivity. Mouse click starts the sound and clears the canvas; mouse location affects the sound.  Fundamental design of the work is based on a custom object and its distribution on to  2-dimensional array structure. Aesthetically it aims to have sharp and gothic look which is provided by the curve arrays. The Usage of the such system creates a ligth efect which can be considered as an illusion. The motion design is layered into sub sections.

ALGORİTHMİC ABSTRACT EXPRESSİONS 000

Press CTRL/Control = STARTS THE SOUND //////// Press SHIFT = Collects and releases brushes /////// MOUSE CLICK = Erases Canvas and plays a pitch /////// Press ARROW KEYS = variates and plays pitches  /////// AAE 000 is an interactive kinetic painting.

Me Negative is an interactive kinetic painting. 4 different brush #Algorithms  are designed to paint the canvas according to constrained randomness.  Mouse Clicks renews the canvas. It is also a sound interactive work. 
Root Frequency: 33 Hz
Brush hits to the edges = 3rd/7th/11th/127th Harmonics (Prime Number Order)
Arrow Keys = 7th/13th/17th/Octave
Mouse Clicks = changes the root frequency of arrow keys by tritone. 

Pressing SHİFT collects all the brush algorithms to the middle. You can experience the kinetic sound of the painting; also you can interact with the painting by playing melodies with arrow keys and mouse clicks.
